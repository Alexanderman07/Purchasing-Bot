## Project Description: 
  This purchase bot is able to locate an item on the Supreme New York website based on the user-specified description of the item on the site. Users must specifiy the KEYWORD(Name), COLOR, and SIZE of the item they want the bot to purchase in order for the bot to successfully locate the item. Once the item has been located by the bot, it adds the item to the cart. The purchase bot then proceeds to the checkout page where the bot auto fills your user and payment details before clicking the "Process Payment" button.
